Hello and welcome! ðŸ¤—
<br><br>

My name is Thu Van, and I am a Software Test Engineer. 

I have always been interested in coding because it enables me to build useful tools, and also simply - because it's fun!

Currently, I am deep diving into Python. Below, you can follow my progress and find some of my projects.

I am excited to be on GitHub, and I am looking forward to this journey of learning, exploring, and growing. ðŸŒ±

Thank you for visiting my page, I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
